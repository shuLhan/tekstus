The following is a '''list of [[United Nations]] resolutions that concern [[Israel]]''' and bordering states such as [[Lebanon]] From [[1967]] to [[1989]]<!-- does anybody have the numbers for the full period from 1946 through today?--> the [[UN Security Council]] passed 131 [[United Nations Security Council resolution|resolutions]] directly addressing the Arab-Israeli conflict. In early Security Council practice, resolutions did not directly invoke [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter|Chapter VII]]. They made an explicit determination of a threat, breach of the peace, or act of aggression, and ordered an action in accordance with Article 39 or 40. Resolution 54 determined that a threat to peace existed within the meaning of Article 39 of the Charter, reiterated the need for a truce, and ordered a cease-fire pursuant to Article 40 of the Charter. Although the phrase "Acting under Chapter VII" was never mentioned as the basis for the action taken, the chapterâ€™s authority was being used.<ref>see [http://www.pcr.uu.se/publications/UCDP_pub/Chapter%20VII%20Resolutions_050921.pdf  Patrik Johansson, UN Security Council Chapter VII resolutions, 1946-2002.
