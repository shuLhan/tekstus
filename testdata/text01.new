Recently, the first conclusive date for king Psusennes II was revealed in a newly published priestly annal stone block. This document, which has been designated as 'Block Karnak 94, CL 2149,' records the induction of a priest named Nesankhefenmaat into the chapel of Amun-Re within the Karnak precint in Year 11 the first month of Shemu day 13 of a king named Psusennes.<ref>Frederic Payraudeau, ''De nouvelles annales sacerdotales de Siamon, Psousennès II et Osorkon Ier.'', BIFAO 108 (2008), p.294</ref> The preceding line of this document recorded the induction of Nesankhefenmaat's father, a certain Nesamun, into the priesthood of Amun-Re in king Siamun's reign.<ref name="Payraudeau, BIFAO 108, p.294">Payraudeau, BIFAO 108, p.294</ref> Siamun was the predecessor of Psusennes II at Tanis. The identification of the aforementioned Psusennes with Psusennes II is certain since the same fragmentary annal document next records—in the following line—the induction of Hor, the son of Nesankhefenmaat, into the priesthood of the chapel of Amun-Re at Karnak in Year 3 the second month of Akhet day 14 of king Osorkon I's reign just one generation later.<ref name="Payraudeau, BIFAO 108, p.294"/>  Therefore, the Year 11 date can only be assigned to Psusennes II and constitutes the first securely attested date for this pharaoh's reign.
