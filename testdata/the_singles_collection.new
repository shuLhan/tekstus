'''''The Singles Collection''''' is the second [[greatest hits]] album from American singer [[Britney Spears]], in honor of her tenth year anniversary under her contract with [[Jive Records]], her record company since 1997. The release follows her previous compilation, ''[[Greatest Hits: My Prerogative]]'' (2004).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.amazon.com/Greatest-Hits-Prerogative-Limited-Bonus/dp/B0006284JQ/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1257812282&sr=8-3|title=Britney Spears releases 2nd Greatest Hits compilation |last=.com|first=amazon|date=2004-11-01|work=[[Amazon.com]]|publisher=Amazon.com, Inc|accessdate=2004-11-02}}</ref> The greatest hits was released on November 10, 2009 in many different formats including a one disc standard edition and an international deluxe double disc. A box set edition was released two weeks after the standard was. 

''The Singles Collection'' was praised by contemporary critics, many noting the influence of Spears in pop music during her first ten years in the music industry. The album includes one new track titled "[[3 (song)|3]]" which was released as the lead single, reaching number one in the United States and Canada.

==Background==
On July 12, 2009, Spears confirmed through her [[Twitter]] that she had begun recording new material, stating that she was going into the studio with [[Sweden|Swedish]] songwriter and producer [[Max Martin]], who produced the album's lead single "[[3 (song)|3]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twitter.com/britneyspears/status/2604590715 |title=Twitter / Britney Spears: In Stockholm in the studio |publisher=Twitter.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-30}}</ref> 

On September 23, 2009, Jive Records initially announced the release date of the album as November 24, 2009 and confirmed the name of the album as ''The Singles Collection'' through Spears's official website.<ref name="jive3">{{cite web|url=http://www.britneyspears.com/2009/09/breaking-news-the-singles-collection-and-new-song-3.php |title=The Singles Collection & New Song "3" |publisher=Britney Spears |date=2009-09-23 |accessdate=2009-09-30}}</ref> On October 14, 2009, Jive Records announced in a new press release that the date for the standard version was moved up to November 10, 2009. The date for the release of the boxset remained the same.<ref name="relnov">{{cite web|url=http://www.britney.com/us/blog/3-shatters-billboard-record-new-release-date |title="3" Shatters Billboard Record + New Release Date |publisher=Britney.com |date=2009-10-14 |accessdate=2009-10-15}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
Stephen Thomas Erlewine of [[Allmusic]] gave the collection five stars and compared it to Spears previous compilation ''[[Greatest Hits: My Prerogative]]'', saying they were "different listening experiences". He also noted that the recent singles "help push ''The Singles'' away from [[teen pop]] and toward pure [[dance-pop]] bliss. [..] It does result in a stronger overall listen, since there are no slow patches here, just a parade of relentless hooks and rhythms that wound up defining the sound of a decade".<ref name="allmusic"/> Mayer Nissim of ''[[Digital Spy]]'' also gave the album five stars saying that "[it] perfectly captures the career of one of the best singles artists of the last ten years. Running from "[[...Baby One More Time (song)|…Baby One More Time]]" to "[[Radar (song)|Radar]]", you get a single-disc timeline that shows a progression in style and substance from school uniform-wearing pop ingénue to sultry motorik saucepot. [..] The only arguable weak link is the [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]-featuring "[[Me Against The Music]]", but in this context what once looked like a respectful passing of the baton now seems like an unconditional surrender of [[Honorific titles in popular music|pop Queendom]] to its rightful heir." The reviewer also noted the impact on [[popular culture]] and pop music of Spears, highlighting "[[Oops!... I Did It Again (song)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]", "[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]" and "[[Stronger (Britney Spears song)|Stronger]]".<ref name="digspy"/> Mike Diver of [[BBC]] called it "the definitive Britney album" and added that "these songs don’t just make a mark, lingering in the memory – they are essential pieces of the past ten years of pop history, and deserve better than dismissal by so-called discerning listeners".<ref name="bbc"/>
