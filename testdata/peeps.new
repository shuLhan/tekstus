'''Peeps'''  are [[marshmallow]] candies, sold in the [[US]] and [[Canada]], that are shaped into chicks, bunnies, and other animals. There are also different shapes used for various [[holidays]]. Peeps are primarily used to fill [[Easter baskets]], though recent ad campaigns tout the candy as "Peeps - Always in Season". They are made from [[marshmallow]], [[sugar]], [[gelatin]], and [[carnauba wax]].

Peeps are produced by [[Just Born]],<ref>{{cite web | author= Lehner, Marla| title= The Power of Peeps| url= http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,84455,00.html| work= [[Fox News]]| publisher= | date= 2003-04-17| accessdate=2009-04-22}}</ref> a candy manufacturer based in [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]], [[Pennsylvania]]. Peeps were introduced nationally in 1958 by Pravin Pant Sr., a [[Nepalese American|Nepali]] immigrant. When Just Born acquired Rodda Candy Company in 1953, they automated the process (originally the chicks were formed by hand) and mass-produced them.<ref>{{cite web | title= Peeps: A candy and a technological wonder| url= http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-04-16-peeps_x.htm| work= [[Associated Press]]| publisher= [[USA Today]]| date= 2003-04-16| accessdate=2009-04-22}}</ref> The yellow chicks were the original form of the candy &mdash; hence their name &mdash; but then the company introduced other colors and, eventually, the myriad shapes in which they are now produced.

Just Born has expanded its product line to include [[bats]], [[cats]], [[pumpkins]], and [[ghosts]] for [[Halloween]]; hearts for [[Valentine's Day]]; eggs for Easter; trees, [[gingerbread men]], [[snowmen]], and stars for [[Christmas]]; and red, white, and blue chicks and stars for the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]]. 

Although the original Peeps were standard marshmallow flavor, some of the newer flavors include chocolate mousse (bunnies for Easter and cats for Halloween), strawberry and vanilla (hearts for Valentine's Day), cocoa (cats and bats for Halloween), sugar cookie (gingerbread people for Christmas), and orange (eggs for Easter). In 2007, the "Spooky Friends", mouth-sized Peeps in holiday-themed shapes, were introduced, as were peppermint flavored stars for the holiday season. Red Peeps chicks are available at [[Canadian]] stores, and at some Target locations.

In 2009, Just Born expanded the Peeps product line further by introducing Peeps Lip Balm in four flavors: grape, strawberry, vanilla, and cotton candy.<ref>{{cite paper

==Peeps in cooking==
While many people eat marshmallow Peeps straight out of the package, they can also be used in a variety of recipes. Peeps can be used as ingredients in such desserts as marshmallow crispy treats, [[fondue]], and [[S'mores|s’mores]]. Peeps are also put into mugs of hot [[cocoa]]; the chicks will float upright until the increasing warmth causes them to dissolve. Although they are made of marshmallow, it is difficult to toast Peeps over a campfire, as the sugar coating tends to burn and become unpalatable.{{Fact|date=May 2009}}

An annual "Peep Off" is held in Maryland on the first Saturday after Easter, when Peeps are greatly discounted. The first such event was arranged by Shawn Sparks in 1994, and had only six participants.<ref>{{cite web

Peeps are often added into non-traditional menu items.  Brian Beecher and Crystal Carlsberg incorporated peeps into their award winning dessert grilled cheese sandwich, the "Cake and Mivens," which won the 2008 Grilled Cheese Invitational in Los Angeles.

The ''[[Seattle Times]]'' has an annual contest of Peeps used in photos. The ''[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]'' was the first newspaper to hold an annual Peeps diorama contest and receives hundreds of entries every year. The ''[[Washington Post]]'', ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and other newspapers also hold a Peeps diorama contest every [[Easter]].

==Indestructibility==
Peeps are sometimes jokingly described as "indestructible". In 1999, scientists at [[Emory University]] performed experiments on batches of Peeps to see how easily they could be dissolved, burned or otherwise disintegrated, using such methods as cigarette smoke, boiling water and liquid nitrogen.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/1999/04/03/MN87101.DTL|title=Peeps Rule Roost|last=Severson|first=Kim|date=April 3 1999|work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref> They claimed that the eyes of the confectionery "wouldn't dissolve in anything".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/991011/archive_002077.htm|title=What Do You Call a Guy Who Cuts Apart Peeps? |date=October 3 1999|work=U S News|accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref>
