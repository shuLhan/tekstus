_textus_ is a latin word for _textual_, meaning of or relating to a text or
texts.

Its pronounciation is _tek-stus_, therefore this repository is named, also
because the word textus is already used by a company and the word _tex_ is
more related to LaTeX.

`tekstus` is a Go library for working with text.
